Assignment reflection:

I had a bad time on the homework assignment. 

I was unable to connect the basic game logic to an on-click event on the image items. I tested the game logic and click events separately. Tying them together always failed however.

Along the way I ran into errors I could not explain. Health (console logged) decreased. 'pocket-lint' values in arrays that I had not added. Code seems to run multiple times, once on page load and once "run the tests!" is pressed. Sometimes a missing semicolon halfway across the page would make all tests fail, even the constants defined at the start.

Workflow:
I started in very small steps, working from on one sub-assignment at a time. I added console.logs along the way. I removed some, but kept the important ones. 

Time spent: 8hrs, excluding short breaks.
When I started I felt I should be able to complete the tasks. Most topics were discussed during the first week. I am unsure what went wrong.
